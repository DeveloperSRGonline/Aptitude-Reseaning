Q.What is percentage?
    . In mathematics , a percentage is a number or ratio that can be experssed as a fraction of 100.
        .Fraction -> p/q form
        -- fraction of 100 means dividing the number by 100 - means dividing that number in 100 parts 
        eg. 1000/100 = 10(one part value) --> is 1% 
                       20(two part value) --> is 2% 
                       20(three part value) --> is 3%

if we have to calculate 42 percentage:
    it is the phenominal formula of percentage:
        1000/100 * 42 = 420

    .we need to take out the percentage of a specific number.
    .kisi bhi value ka 10% calculate karna hai toh bas ek point phiche kar dena bas 
    .formula of percentage is :- (valur * percentage)/100
        

        Example : 10% of 80
                    (80/100)*10 = 8 -- normal way
                    short cut --> we know that 10% means ek point pichhe => i.e - "8"

                  20% of 150
                    (150/100)*20 = 

                                    TRICK 2

    .comparing two numbers on the basis of their value percentage.
    .Just assume you are giving two numbers and we need to fing the percentage of first number in comparision to another number.

    Example - 20 is what percentage of 80
                (80*x)/100 = 20 ..  so ... x = (20/80)*100 ==> x = 25
            - 30 is what percentage of 90
